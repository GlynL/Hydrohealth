            <p><h1>About Hydrohealth</h1></p>
            <p> Margaret Lewington is the principle of Hydrohealth private physiotherapy practice.</p>
            <p>Margaret has worked continuously as a physiotherapist since graduating in 1978 from the University of Queensland. She has experience in a variety of fields, including hospital, domiciliary, therapy centre and private practice. She gained post-graduate qualifications in Hydrotherapy in 1989. Following this she commenced her own private practice.</p>
            <p>At this time, Hydrohealth was mainly hydrotherapy treatment, treating all conditions, especially arthritis, orthopaedics, pain and other musculoskeletal conditions. It was also a time that Margaret’s interest in helping people with Ankylosing Spondylitis grew. Activities in the pool are very helpful for people with AS to exercise and stretch more fully with less pain.</p>
            <p>In 2004,  Margaret commenced physiotherapy sessions in her rooms which allowed her to expand her work with people with AS. She now provides a combination of land and pool sessions.</p>
            <p>Margaret has taken the weekly hydrotherapy exercise class since 1990. She works closely with the Ankylosing Spondylitis Group of Queensland and puts an exercise section in each of the editions of their newsletter, 4 times per year.</p>
            <p>Margaret has run many educational and exercise weekends in Brisbane and regional Queensland centres and has visited programmes in other states and overseas. She spent a month as a visitor at the RNHRD in Bath, UK, working with the two week full time inpatient programme for people with AS.</p>
            <p>Margaret has presented at several Australian Rheumatology Association / Allied Health Professional conferences as well as at Aquatic Physiotherapy conferences on the topics of Physiotherapy and Ankylosing Spondylitis as well as Aquatic Physiotherapy.</p>
            <p>Margaret was a consultant physio to the Ankylosing Spondylitis Specialist Clinic at the P.A. Hospital, when it was commenced, for 7 years.</p>
            <p><em>“I am committed to providing “excellence of care” for all people who I see, both for hydrotherapy and people with Ankylosing Spondylitis” --- Margaret</em></p>
            <p>Hydrohealth’s mission is to optimize client health through a “less pain – more gain” motto. Through the prescription of an individualised exercise programme and “hands-on” techniques, with the purpose of mobilising, stretching, and increasing muscle strength, Hydrohealth is beneficial for everyone.</p>
