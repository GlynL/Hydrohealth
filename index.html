            <p><h2>Hydrohealth</h2> is the private physiotherapy practice of Margaret Lewington</p> 
            <p>Physiotherapy is a physical solution to common problems involving impaired mobility and function, quality of life and independence.</p> 
            <p>Margaret has two main interests:     Hydrotherapy/Aquatic Physiotherapy  and Physiotherapy Management of Ankylosing Spondylitis and Ax SpA.</p>
            <p>Margaret offers a ‘hands on’ approach, providing a comprehensive assessment and treatment, including individual rehabilitation programmes suited to your needs and lifestyle.</p>

            <p><h2>Hydrotherapy</h2> or Aquatic Physiotherapy is a physiotherapy treatment carried out in the water, usually a heated pool. The warmth and buoyancy of the water greatly assist pain relief and relaxation. Hydrotherapy is an appropriate and effective form of treatment for all age groups and the majority of conditions. It allows the benefits of exercise to be combined with the additional benefits of immersion in water. The physiotherapist is usually in the pool with the patient and is able to do a variety of “hands on” techniques, including  joint mobilisation, soft tissue techniques, stretching as well as guiding and correcting exercise and movement technique. People enjoy the water, feel good in it, and can achieve a great deal.</p>
            <p>Margaret has a particular interest in treating people in a warm hydrotherapy pool, using manual techniques and exercises. Once an exercise programme has been prescribed, and if you are assessed as being safe and it is appropriate, you may continue your exercise programme independently.</p>
            <p>Physio the Hydro Way   —   Less Pain,   More Gain</p>
            
            <br>

            <p><h2>Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)</h2> is a type of inflammatory arthritis. It is a painful, chronic rheumatic condition which affects the spine, especially the back and neck. It can also affect other joints, tendons and ligaments and other areas, such as the eyes. For most people, AS is not a barrier to employment, raising a family and keeping physically active. It is essential to get the correct diagnosis and best treatment. Seeing a rheumatologist is important, as is seeing a physiotherapist with experience in this area. You can do a lot to help yourself, but you need the help of people who know about AS and it’s management to help, guide and encourage you. Keeping active and fit, doing exercises to move, stretch and strengthen are the keys to effective management and living well.</p>
